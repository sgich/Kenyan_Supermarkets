## __Hypothesis Testing on Kenyan Supermarkets Dataset__ ##


## _Description_ ##

As we are in the data age, where decisions are increasingly being made by the backing of data not as a luxury but necessity so as to gain advantage over competitors, or just for better decision making the gap in implementation between the rest of the world and Africa continues to grow regardless of the boom in tech startups on the continent. Aside from major organizations who see the value in this kind of decision making, policies and attitudes in the upper management of most companies and government institutions lag behind and this is because of a lack sensitization to the benefits of data backed decision making. Supermarkets are an example of companies or businesses that would benefit from this. In Kenya, there's a vibrant retail industry especially the supermarkets, though data is limited due to lack of data structures to collect data we can still derive some interesting insights into the industry given the limited dataset we obtained.

The dataset, through Exploratory Data Analysis, will be used to identify patterns that may assist businesses optimise and or increase revenue from showing trends or relationships that were not obvious before analysis. The Hypothesis test for this case, is to check based on sampling whether the mean money spent by customers on food in a chain store (big store) is greater than or equal to the mean money spent on food by customers in a small store.
